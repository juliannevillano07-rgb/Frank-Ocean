<p>Frank Ocean was born in Long Beach, California, 
on October 28, 1987. He grew up in New Orleans, but moved 
to Los Angeles in his late teens to pursue a career in music. 
Ocean started out ghostwriting tracks for such pop stars as Justin Bieber and Beyoncé, 
but soon achieved fame as an artist when, in 2011, he released a mixtape of his own music, 
titled nostalgia, ULTRA. His next effort, channel ORANGE, was unveiled in 2012 to both 
critical and popular acclaim, and he followed with the back-to-back releases of Endless 
and Blonde in 2016.</p>
